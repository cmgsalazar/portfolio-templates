# Quick templates for SOJ 2025

Sharing some portfolio-site config files, for friends — or anyone else, really — looking for quick and lightweight templates to publish on Github Pages.

Disclaimer: These templates are stripped-down, early versions of my [personal site](https://cmgsalazar.github.io). Most customizations were removed to keep the files clean and reusable. That said, there may still be stray classes and styling properties. 

These are not meant to be fully styled themes, but feel free to grab what you might need. (Credit is optional but much appreciated.)

## How to use 

1. Clone or download this repository. You can do this by clicking the green `<> Code` button above, then download ZIP. Alternatively, `git clone https://github.com/cmgsalazar/portfolio-templates.git`
2. Select which version you prefer to use for your site.
3. Drop the files into your own Github Pages repository.
4. Edit and add assets, as necessary. Customize styling and layout, as preferred.
5. Deploy via Github Pages.

If you used or adapted any of these templates, I’d love to see your site. :)
